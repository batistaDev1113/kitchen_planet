# Kitchen Planet Restaurant finder App

Welcome to the Diner Planet Restaurant App README! This document will provide you with an overview of our project, the technologies we've used, the features we've implemented, and our plans for future development.

## Purpose

Kitchen Planet Restaurant finder App aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both restaurant owners and customers. Our goal is to help food lovers find local restaurants by offering a digital platform that enhances their search experience. Users can effortlessly discover restaurants, check previous client's reviews and make informed decisions based on feedback provided by other users.

## Technologies

- <strong>Frontend:</strong> I have developed the user interface using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It provides a smooth and interactive experience for users accessing the app via web browsers.
- <strong>Search:</strong> Implemented a search feature that allows users to search for restaurants by name, cuisine, or location.
- <strong>Filter:</strong> A filter feature has been added that allows users to filter restaurants by rating, and cuisine.

## Future Work

I have an exciting roadmap for the future of the Kitchen Planet Restaurant App:

- <strong>Maps:</strong> I will add a map feature that allows users to view the location of restaurants.
- <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> I will add a responsive design feature that allows users to access the app on mobile devices.
- <strong>Deployment:</strong> I will deploy the app to a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
- <strong>Static typing</strong> Once everything is working as expected, all the code base will be migrated to TypeScript.
- <strong>Testing:</strong> I will add unit tests to ensure that the app is working as expected.
